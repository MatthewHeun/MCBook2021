Equation~\ref{eq:IPARX} (repeated below for convenience)
is our conceptual framework for considering sustainability.
Chapter~\ref{chap:planetary_boundaries} discussed planetary boundaries and the impact
of human activities on those boundaries, that is, the left-hand side of Equation~\ref{eq:IPARX}.
Chapter~\ref{chap:population} is about the first term on the right-hand side of 
Equation~\ref{eq:IPARX}, world population and its dynamics. 
Discussion questions from Chapter~\ref{chap:population} reveal a variety of ways 
in which it is practically and morally difficult to reduce impacts~($I$) by reducing 
population~($P$).
This chapter examines the second term on the right-hand side of Equation~\ref{eq:IPARX},
affluence~($A$), and the role of human economic activity in sustainability challenges.
Chapters~\ref{chap:resource_intensity}--\ref{chap:impact_intensity}, 
finish the development of our framework for sustainability.

\section{Global affluence}
\label{sec:Global_affluence}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The word wealth can include notions of happiness, prosperity, well being, and welfare,
but mostly wealth refers to the \emph{amount} of goods, possessions, money,
property, or ``stuff'' owned by a person.
In other words, wealth refers to a \emph{level} of material possessions or resources.
In contrast, affluence ($A$) is the \emph{rate} that the economy
uses up goods and services, that is, the amount of ``stuff'' bought \emph{per year}.

Economic activity may mean literally consumption, as in the case with food,
or it could mean using a service, such as education or getting a haircut.
Sometimes, what is ``consumed'' is ancillary to what the consumer actually desires.
For example, when a person travels from point A to point B,
whether the car is electric or burns gasoline doesnâ€™t matter (to the traveler).
The energy consumed is just a means to an end, often called the ``service.''
(In this example, the energy service is travel.)

Average affluence ($A$) for a country or the world
is \emph{measured} by gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.
There are valid critiques as to why per capita GDP is not the \emph{best possible}
measure of affluence.
For instance, GDP doesn't count (or under counts) the value
of innovation in improving standards of living~\cite{Gordon2016}.
Many new metrics (see Section~\ref{sec:indices}) have been proposed as replacements
or improvements for GDP.
Some examples are green GDP, the index of sustainable economic welfare, and the
genuine progress indicator.
However, each of these suffers from its own limitations.%, philosophical, methodological, and practical.
The biggest limitation is standardization and availability of data.
GDP is what we have the most data for and, consequently,
it is the affluence indicator ``everyone'' uses.
I.e., GDP is the \emph{de facto} standard.
% put in the streetlight effect, McNamara's fallacy, and/or Goodhart's law?
Consistent and easily accessible GDP data can allow us to make observations
about trends, which are \emph{qualitatively} consistent with trends we would observe
using other indices, bearing in mind the limitations of what GDP measures and what it doesn't.
In any case, a different measure of affluence~($A$), would require a corresponding
adjustment to (the measure of) resource intensity of economic activity~($R$).
Regardless of the measure of affluence, we land in the same difficult spot:
greater affluence~($A$) creates greater environmental impact~($I$)
if the resource intensity of the economy~($R$) and the impact intensity of resources~($X$)
(discussed in the next chapter) is unchanged.

Figures~\ref{fig:AffluenceGraph-Nordhaus} and~\ref{fig:GDPGraph-Nordhaus} show
world annual GDP per capita and total GDP, respectively.
Note that most national and international economic policy is explicitly and
purposely devoted to increasing affluence and maintaining continual growth for GDP
(as shown in Figures~\ref{fig:AffluenceGraph-Nordhaus} and~\ref{fig:GDPGraph-Nordhaus}),
even though perpetual growth of consumption of finite
resources is ultimately unsustainable. 
(See Section~\ref{sec:exp}.)

GDP data are collected nationally and aggregated internationally, 
so there is often skepticism of data provided by corrupt and/or authoritarian
regimes, in addition to the caveats about what GDP measures and what it doesn't.
GDP is denominated in units of money and is the sum of four terms:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:GDP}
  GDP = c + g + i + nx \; .
\end{equation}

%..............................
\paragraph{Consumption}
%..............................

Consumption~($c$) is purchases made by individuals.
Typically, consumption is about two thirds of GDP for developed economies and is
usually divided into three subcategories: durable goods, nondurable goods, and services.
Services represent nontangible things, such as haircuts, legal advice, education,
and concert tickets.
Durable goods are defined as things that last longer than 3 years,
such as appliances and automobiles.
Nondurable goods are things that are consumed immediately, like food, paper, or fuel.
Fabrics, like clothes or carpet, are counted as nondurable goods, even if they
happen to last more than three years.
Durable goods spending is more sensitive to economic conditions than nondurable
goods spending,
because consumers can usually choose to postpone spending on durable goods
until circumstances improve.


%..............................
\paragraph{Government spending}
%..............................

Government spending~($g$) is comprised of government consumption
(such as equipment and wages paid to government workers) and net investment, for
example, infrastructure improvements.


%..............................
\paragraph{Investment}
%..............................

Investment~($i$) is \emph{not} money put into a bank account.
Investment is goods that are purchased now for use in the future.
There are three subcategories of investment: nonresidential fixed investment,
residential fixed investment, and inventory investment.
Nonresidential fixed investment is equipment and plants (factories) purchased by firms.
In contrast, residential fixed investment is the purchase of housing stock by
households and landlords.
Inventory investment is the purchase, by firms, of goods for later sale and could
be negative (inventory is falling) or positive (inventory is increasing).


%..............................
\paragraph{Net exports}
%..............................

Net exports~($nx$) are the \emph{net} difference between the value of exports and the value of imports.
Thus, $nx$ could be a negative number for a country that imports more than it exports.
World GDP is the sum of all national GDPs.
Therefore, for world GDP, $nx = 0$.
We don't import from or export to space, \ldots yet.


%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Production/Affluence balance}
\label{sec:PCbalance}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Although economists use consumption narrowly as described in Equation~\ref{eq:GDP},
we use the term colloquially to mean the sum of personal consumption, 
government spending, and investment.
That is, we use the term ``consumption'' to mean global GDP, in part to remind ourselves
that economic activity is based on the use of resources.
Individuals and corporations may ``save'' money for purchases in the future, but the
economy as a whole balances production and (this more generic form of) consumption as 
closely as possible, such that

\begin{equation} \label{eq:PCbalance}
  \mathrm{Production} = \mathrm{Consumption} \; .
\end{equation}
%
Money that is invested in a bank is lent out to borrowers so that they can make
purchases.
Money invested in the stock market is used by companies to purchase equipment, 
do research, or grow the business in some other way.
Goods and services must be produced before they can be used.
There is no incentive to produce goods that aren't used;
why would you pay the costs of production if there were no prospects of a sale?
% Storage and maintenance costs further discourage excess production.
% Note that temporary ``buffering'' is categorically different from a long-term 
% imbalance of excess production. 
% Many agricultural products are harvested in a short period of time and then stored 
% and sold at uniform rate.
% Selling apples throughout the year out of cold storage facilities is not the same
% as growing apples that no one will ever eat.
% Likewise, inventory investment (mentioned above) is a relatively short-term expense
% to have goods available when customers want them, not a long-term difference in
% supply and demand.
%
Therefore, we use the terms ``production'' and ``consumption'' interchangeably.


%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Economic metabolism}
\label{sec:econ_metab}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Having established that the economy only consumes what the economy produces and,
likewise, only things that will be consumed are produced, we are ready to introduce
the metaphor of the economic metabolism.
All plant and animal metabolisms consume resources
(energy and materials) 
and produce wastes in the process of doing useful things.
Similarly, economies take in resources and produce wastes.

%^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
\begin{mcframe}[0.90\textwidth](0.85\textwidth)
%^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Thus, the economy is society's metabolism.

\end{mcframe}

One way of looking at Equation~\ref{eq:IPARX} is that impacts ($I$)
are the \emph{result} of economic activity.
I.e., environmental impacts are the result of society's metabolism.
Total consumption, that is, world GDP, is $P \times A$ in Equation~\ref{eq:IPARX}.
Resources ($R$) are the feed the economy needs to live and grow.
The impact intensity of resources~($X$) 
represents the wastes that the economy excretes.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Economic change}
\label{sec:EconGrowth}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Although production and consumption are in balance, both may change together.
In fact, growth in GDP per capita~($A$) is the explicit goal of many economic policies.
There are two ways the economy can increase GDP.
Either (a)~the economy consumes \emph{more} inputs or
(b)~it uses existing inputs more \emph{efficiently}.
Economic inputs include labor, capital, energy, and materials.
In the long run, growing output by scaling up the inputs does not increase 
affluence because more workers are needed to gather, process, and use the 
additional resources.
That leaves only efficiency as a means of boosting affluence.
From a sustainability point of view, we should want to everything to be used
as efficiently as possible; inefficiency of any kind is not desirable.

The productivity of labor depends on the education and skill 
of workers, technology, the number of workers in the population, the number of hours they 
work, and the faction of the population that is working.
(See Section \ref{sec:dtt}.)
More workers will increase economic output but will not increase GDP \emph{per person}.
A greater fraction of the population working, such as with the demographic dividend, 
or workers working longer hours will tend to increase $A$ (at least until the 
population pyramid stabilizes, in the case of the demographic dividend).

Capital is buildings, equipment, machines, and tools---\emph{things}
that make workers more productive.
For instance, a builder with a backhoe can excavate a foundation faster than a
builder with only a shovel.
More capital investment \emph{sometimes} means greater economic output.
Because capital depreciates over time, continual investment 
(part of $i$ in Equation~\ref{eq:GDP})
is needed to maintain a certain level of capital stock. 
The greater the level of capital, the larger the yearly investment is needed to
maintain it.
At some point, there is a \emph{maximum} level of effective capital.
Beyond that point, the capital is more expensive to maintain than it contributes 
to the economy.
Where this point is depends on the level of technology and the price of borrowing
money (that is, interest) for making capital investments.
Conceptually, at the effective maximum level of capital, labor will have a maximum
level of output. 
(At that point, workers are fully ``tooled up.'')

Innovation is the major source of economic growth.
There are two types of innovation: the invention of new \emph{kinds} of goods and
services \emph{or} improvements to efficiency.
The majority of the goods and services we consume today did not exist in 
1870~\cite{Gordon2016}.
Today, we consume entirely new categories of goods and services that did not
exist for most of human history.
Much of the improvement in our standard of living comes from these innovations.

However, if you look close enough, almost all of these ``new goods'' stories 
\emph{also} end up being about some form of efficiency.
The endless quest to meet our needs more efficiently allows us to instead spend
our budget on \emph{additional} consumption.
Efficiency improvements allow us to get more GDP for the same level of resource consumption.
As we will see in Chapter~\ref{chap:resource_intensity}, particularly in 
Figures~\ref{fig:per_capita_material_use} and~\ref{fig:EnergyPerPersonGraph},
economic growth, measured by GDP per capita---primarily driven by improvements
in material and energy efficiency (that is, ``innovation'')---results not in 
less consumption but more.
**** The preceding sentence could use a rework. 
It is rather complicated. ---MKH
****
Managing the ``rebound effect,'' which is when improvements in efficiency result in
greater total consumption, is a major sustainability challenge.

***** Would it be possible to also talk about economic contraction here? ---MKH *****



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Economic level}
\label{sec:circular_economy}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

World economies are managed to exhibit continual growth 
(see Project~P1.\ref{project:alt_exp} for the relationship between continual growth
and exponential growth).
As has been mentioned a few times already, continual growth is inherently
unsustainable on a finite planet.
When the economy grows, at some point, it either demands more resources than the 
environment can provide and/or the wastes generated exceed the ecosystem's 
ability to absorb.
That is, eventually economic growth either exceeds the ecosystem's ability to provision
or the ecosystem's regulating and support services pass a tipping point, as 
discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:planetary_boundaries}.

In light of these facts, there are have been calls for a \emph{zero-growth}, or 
\emph{steady-state}, economy.
These proposals address economic growth, that is the changing size of the 
economy, but they don't address what that size is.
It is the magnitude of economic activity (that is, the total amount of consumption) 
that matters for sustainability -- as exemplified in Figure \ref{fig:FootprintHDIGraph},
which suggests that our current level of economic activity is \emph{already} too large.

Therefore, some proposals go further and call for \emph{de-growth}, that is, 
reducing the size of the economy.
There are substantial social and political pressures against making these changes.
(And for good reasons!)
A steady-state economy would imply no change in the standard of living from 
generation to generation, as was the case for the ancient and medieval world. 
Degrowth would imply a worsening in the standard of living.
Although Figure \ref{fig:FootprintHDIGraph} implies a lower standard of living
is necessary for sustainability, accepting a drastically lower standard of 
living is extremely unpalatable for most people.
Furthermore, there are costs and difficulties associated with \emph{transitioning}
from one type of economy to another. 
The costs are real and there has been no political will or action to make 
such a transition feasible in the amount of time it would take to avoid a climate
crisis.

Another alternative is a \emph{circular} economy\index{economy, circular}, 
which is one that exists only on recycled (and, perhaps, renewable) materials 
and which emits no wastes. 
Such an economy is impossible to fully achieve but may be a good model to strive
for in some ways.
Materials cannot be 100\% recycled and, for many materials, the recycling process
degrades material properties. 
The biggest flaw in a circular economy is that it requires continual energy input,
in part because recycling of materials requires energy.
Lastly, it is not clear that such a system can be \emph{economically} sustainable.

When we look at things through the economic lens, Figure \ref{fig:FootprintHDIGraph}
suggests the only way to live sustainably is poverty. 
The next two chapters will examine this dilemma in more detail.
Perhaps, as we hope, there is a way to enjoy a high standard of living \emph{and}
be sustainable.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Individual affluence}
\label{sec:individual_affluence}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Human wants are limitless. 
However much we have, we always want more. 
Note the fact that we have \emph{desires} for more don't necessarily make us happier
when those desires are fulfilled.
Conversely, even though people \emph{can} find happiness in the midst of hardship,
want, or poverty, doesn't mean they desire those things.
Human want extends to choice as well. 
We would like to be able to choose what (and how much) we consume and to control
our world, but choice and control don't necessarily make us happier, per se.

Therefore, any reduction in affluence or choice runs counter to what people want.
Immediately, we can see a challenge with attempting to reduce impacts ($I$) by
reducing affluence ($A$) -- it will make people less well off. 
Many proposals for becoming more sustainable are effectively reductions to
affluence. 
Poverty is a hard sell on an individual level; no one wants it for themselves.
(Note that an abstract desire to have lower impacts is not the same as wanting 
to be poor.)
Lower levels of affluence are associated with lower HDI, as Figure 
\ref{fig:FootprintHDIGraph} shows. 


Some people \emph{have} chosen (relative) poverty by trying to escape the economic
system; see P4.\ref{project:off-grid} below for examples.
Often, for these people, independence or being ``off grid'' is the main attraction.
However, even for these people, there is no escaping the relationship to rest of
humanity.
There is always some participation in the broader economy, as the project shows,
so there is no escaping the sustainability implications of economic activity.

This chapter's end-of-chapter questions will further explore of the thorny issues 
of attempting to lower impacts by lowering affluence.

      What are the implications for your lifestyle/level of consumption?
      How do you plan to allocate your income between consumption and residential 
      fixed investment?

\item Discuss how our perception of our needs is shaped by what is technologically 
      possible. Are mobile devices necessary? (Many 19th and 20th century CEOs
      didn't have mobile devices.) Are tablets or laptops necessary for school?
      Many children in the 1980s didn't have school computers. 
      Chemotherapy for cancer can be quite costly. What rights do people have for 
      medical care? (President Abraham Lincoln's son William died of a fever
      in the White House in 1862 of causes that are likely quite treatable with
      modern medicine.)
      
\item Consider how having choice(s) creates well being. In times past it was common
      to give a shop keeper a list of desired food items and they would select
      for you (often from quite a limited stock). 
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item Would you like to return to such a system? 
      \item How do you decide to make purchases, say for items that cost more
      than \$100? Do you use reviews, comments, or buying guides? How do the aides
      to navigating choice also improve your well being? 
      \item Consider the sustainability impacts of having more choices. 
      Does having more kinds of products available affect sustainability? 
      How about different ways of doing things? (For instance,
      self-service grocery stores were much more efficient than having customers
      wait for clerks to pick out goods. ``Technology,'' that is, the way we do
      things, has real economic consequences.)
      \end{enumerate}
      
\item Extensions have been proposed for GDP that add environmental variables, 
      such as natural capital, to GDP. Consider extensions to GDP that would
      add \emph{social capital} to GDP. What such variables would you consider?
      
\item Why do we have (global/local) poverty beside (global/local) affluence?
      Do you interpret this question to be about the sources of poverty or to be
      about the sources of affluence? 
      Does one interpretation or another make a difference in how you answer?

\item GDP measures income, that is, what we produce in a year.  
      But social standing doesnâ€™t just depend on our income this year; wealth also matters.
      % GDP, because it represents consumption, is only a partial indication of wealth. 
      % For instance, owning an asset, like land or a valuable painting, doesnâ€™t factor into GDP. 
      Thus, GDP may be less useful than measures of wealth for discussions of 
      social sustainability. 
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item How are wealth inequality and income inequality different? 
      Which do you think is worse from a social perspective and why? 
      \item Consider those who might be asset rich and income poor, like farmers,
      small business owners, or someone without a job but who has inherited a 
      large amount of wealth. Also consider those who might be asset poor and 
      income rich, like a doctor or lawyer paying off medical- or law-school loans.
      How might their patterns of affluence (consumption) be similar or different?
      How do they each affect environmental, economic, and social sustainability?
      \item How might your notions of wealth and income inequality scale to the 
      macroeconomic level?
      \end{enumerate}

\item Is there such a thing as a steady-state economy? 
      What would have to be true for a steady-state economy to exist?
      Under what conditions is a steady-state economy sustainable?
      
\item One strategy to make electricity grids more efficient is to employ load shedding.
      A typical example is where, in exchange for a lower electric rate, your 
      power provider can switch off some of your larger loads, typically your 
      air-conditioning unit. How much of a discount would it take for \emph{you}
      to give up (some) control (that is, choice) of your electricity consumption?
      What does this tell you about your consumer preferences?
      
\item Some (high-end!) apparel has been made a circular economy in that the manufacturer(s)
      will accept the worn-out garment back for recycling. 
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item Discuss the energy impacts of such a scheme, particularly with 
      respect to transportation. 
      \item Consider the price of such garments. What is the net effect of buying 
      such garments as opposed to more bargain clothing (make reference to Equation \ref{eq:IPARX}
      in your answer). 
      \item Is clothing a good candidate for a circular economy?
      What more would you wish to know to answer with confidence? 
      \item What is the 
      energy content of clothing in its various life stages (materials, manufacture
      transportation, retail, washing, disposal)?
      How would you find out?
      \end{enumerate}
      
\item Degrowth is one way to limit environmental impacts. 
      Developed economies do not wish to lower their standards of living. 
      Developing economies want their opportunity to enjoy higher standards of 
      living, hence the idea of ``sustainable development.'' 
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item Explain how developed economies telling less-developed economies not to 
      impact the environment feels like neo-imperialism. 
      \item On the other hand, developed countries have lots of experience with what 
      not to do. 
      What are some communication strategies that are helpful for cross-cultural projects?
      \end{enumerate}
      
\item It has been observed that goods can move relatively freely across international
      borders but labor can't. 
      What are the consequences of leaving behind the environmental and social 
      impacts of manufacturing when goods travel globally?
      (That is, divorcing the product from its manufacturing impacts.) 
      What are the purely economic effects?

\item ``It's hard to fight economics.'' What does this statement imply for
      environmental sustainability and social sustainability?      
      
\item Sometimes you'll hear (well meaning) people blame corporations for wanting
      to ``maximize profit.'' One way of evaluating this view is to realize that 
      \emph{not} maximizing profit when you have the opportunity to do so is 
      wasteful. All of us should be as efficient as possible. 
      To what extent should we be as efficient as possible? In what ways? 
      Are some areas or domains ``off-limits'' to efficiency maximizing and what are they? Why?
      (Other approaches to this question are presented in Chapter \ref{chap:government}.)
      
\item IPCC6's \emph{most optimistic} scenario (see Chapter~\ref{chap:introduction}
      Further Reading) is a 0.5m sea-level rise by 2100.
      Coastal cities and beach-front properties will be most affected and, in 
      many cases, most able to pay for mitigation. 
      Given the expected future costs of fighting sea-level rise, why don't 
      coastal dwellers pay now to prevent future warming? 
      They could pay carbon emitters far from the coasts not to emit. 
      What would it take for such a market to develop?

\begin{projects}


\item Prepare a report that compares and contrasts several measures of affluence,
      economic progress, standard of living and/or economic development.

\item Prepare a report that compares and contrasts several alternative measures of GDP,
      such as the index of sustainable economic welfare, and the 
      genuine progress indicator.
      
\item Prepare a report on income inequality and/or wealth inequality. What are its
      causes? How is it measured? What are its consequences? Should it be remedied, 
      and if so, how?

\item Efforts to develop in ways that are more environmentally friendly are often
      hampered by lack of resources or infrastructure. International aid attempts
      to provide assistance to developing economies to do development ``right.''
      Many times projects are unsuccessful. Local corruption might waste funds.
      \emph{Or} international aid agencies might attempt to maintain control but,
      because they knowledge of the local context, they end up being ineffective. 
      Research examples of successful development projects.
      What are some management strategies that work for international and cross-cultural
      projects?

\item Develop metrics for evaluating when and to what extent a circular economy 
      makes environmental and economic sense for some product.
      
\item What are ways that governments try to control the rate of economic growth?

\item Research the standards, processes, and methods for collecting and disseminating 
      global economic statistics.

\item Research an individual or group who has chosen an off-grid or otherwise
      unconventional lifestyle.
      Suggested subjects include the Amish, the Lykov family, and Richard Proenneke.
      To what extent are they able to avoid interacting with the broader economic system?
      Pay particular attention to medical care, food, clothing, education,
      literature, and tools/machines, all of which are difficult to be completely 
      self-sufficient with respect to.
      Furthermore, what starting ``wealth'' (in whatever form) did these people 
      have, versus what ``income'' did they/do they generate to add to or subtract
      from that initial amount?
