\section{Land and how it is used}
\label{sec:land_and_how_it_is_used}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Of the three means of production (land, labor, capital), economists generally 
consider only land to be a fixed quantity.
This is approximately true. There are ways of creating more land. 
The Dutch system of building dykes to reclaim land from the ocean is one example. 
Planetary colonization could be another. 
Structures such as multi-story parking garages, high-rise apartment buildings, 
and off-shore oil platforms are also ways to 
multiply the {\i effective use} of the land. 
% Change in efficiency. but land is constant. 
Techniques that increase agricultural productivity \emph{per acre} 
are effectively equivalent to creating more farm land. 
But, all these aside, it remains true that the surface area of planet Earth is a 
fixed quantity and that the various methods described above have very little 
\emph{relative effect} on the total land available for human use.

Figure \ref{fig:USlanduse} how land is used in the United States. Although 
proportions may be different in other economies, the categories are the same. 
Land is a place to live. It is a primary input in agriculture, and so is 
basically the source of most of humanity's food supply. Land is the primary 
source of energy, be it fossil fuel, biomass, or renewable. Land can also be a
major carbon sink. Land use affects and is affected by climate change. 
This chapter gives an overview of how land use 
% need better language.
intersects sustainability challenges discussed in other chapters. 
% What's the "sustainability tool" in this chapter? = MAJOR on SOURCE.
% Minor on Sink. Efficiency metrics for land use -> major idea of highest ROI. 




Related to sustainability, three questions related to land use are 
"Is this the right use?" "How efficient is this?" 
"How do we transition?"

\section{Land use efficiency}
\label{sec:land_efficiency}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

There are 1.9 billion acres in the contiguous 48 states. Of this total, 
Figure \ref{fig:USlanduse} shows that
forestry (28\%), grazing (34\%), and crop production (20.6\%) are the three largest uses. 
% Need global numbers too!
In other words, land in the US is largely used for agriculture in one form or another.

and measures of agricultural productivity and efficiency.

Since land limited resource, it makes sense to maximize the productivity of that resource. 
Various metrics could be used to gauge the productivity of the land, for example, 
calories per acre, pounds of food per acre, number of people fed per acre, or 
Joules per food calorie. 
(The differences between what these metrics tell us are in themselves interesting.)
What about crop diversity (consumer choice)?
% Josh: do we have any of these numbers (graph with time?)
We care about multifactor indices: biodiverstiy, wilderness, ecosystem services, 
air and water quality, etc.

Urban land is much more economically productive than rural land (citation needed), 
so metrics like population per square kilometer
(population density) or GDP per acre are also important.

Envriornmental impact per GDP or per area.

Link emissions to urban planning, efficiency, and minimizing transportation and maximizing productivity (GDP).

Challenges of dealing with the built environment, mismatch of information and timescales.

stored per meter squared but we need to know how many square meters of each terrain is available.

\begin{questions}

\item Urbanization provides another illustration of interactions.
Though only about 2\% of Earthâ€™s land surface is covered by builtup area, the effect of urban systems on ecosystems extends well
beyond urban boundaries. Three processes of urban change appear to be of relevance for ecosystem change: the growth of urban
population (urbanization), the growth of built-up area (urban
growth), and the spreading of urban functions into the urban hinterland connected with a decrease in the urban-rural gradient in
population density, land prices, and so on (urban sprawl).
