% OUtline:
% 1. What do we use land for USDA/IPCC/ESA-CSI classifications and data.
% How has this changed over time?
% 2. Metrics for success: population density, cal/acre, etc. What would these be for 
% urban, (suburban?), rural?
% How can we align policies/incentives with optimal outcomes?
% 3. Sustainability implications: unlimited city growth, ag output, CO2.

% Intro.
% IPCC6 contribution of land use to climate change.
% Land use and extinction rate (habitat loss).
% Agriculture and run-off (nitrogen cycle).
% food, food energy, EROI, and sustainability.
% We need a place to live, get resources, recreate (cultural ecosystem services).
% Layout matters for transportation.

% \subsection{Land as source and sink}
% Minerals. forest and agricultural products. solar (and wind) energy.
% 
% % sinks
% Landfill AND litter. What ends up in the ocean? Lots of carbon. 
% 
% Interconnections (air, land, water), pollution dispersion, and rates of pollution persistance. 
% 
% \subsection{Interconnections}
% \subsubsection{Air} The carbon cycle. Albedo (do we have an explicit {\i climate} focus to the book?) Wind-bourne soils.
% \subsubsection{Water} Agricultural runoff (in the water chapter?). Kent County drain commission. 
% \subsubsection{Transportation} Location, location, location
% \subsubsection{Policy?} Who owns what. who has access. culture and history play into these questions. Zoning as an implementation of social policy. Why 1-acre suburban lots? Leon, France vs. Grand Rapids -- much more concentrated. Why?
% 
% \section{Tradeoffs}
% Can land be used for only one thing? See land use map. There are tradeoffs between those uses. Location vs. transportation. What is the purpose of wilderness?
