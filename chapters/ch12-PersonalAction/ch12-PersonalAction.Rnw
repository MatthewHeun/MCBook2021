\chapter{Personal action}
\label{chap:personal_action}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\epigraph{People donâ€™t spring into action just because they see smoke; 
they spring into action because they see others rushing in with water.}
{Leor Hackel and Gregg Sparkman} % on Slate.com Oct. 26, 2018.

This is the second of two chapters on actions to encourage sustainable 
living for individuals and society.
This chapter is a companion to 
Chapter~\ref{chap:government},
which focused on collective actions
by government and large organizations, 
to change the ``rules of the game.''
In contrast, 
this chapter (\ref{chap:personal_action}) focuses on individual actions
that can be taken 
within existing systems, structures, and political environments.

This chapter answers the question 
``what can I do today to live a more sustainable life?''
Again, like Chapter~\ref{chap:government}, 
there are many ways that individuals can take action
to become more sustainable. 
This chapter opens with stories of individuals strving to live
more sustainbale lives. 
Thereafter, the chapter is structured similarly 
to Chapter~\ref{chap:government}
with lists actions, organized first by
the $PARC$ terms (Chapters~\ref{chap:population}--\ref{chap:carbon_intensity})
of the IPARC equation (Equation~\ref{eq:IPARC})
and second by 
areas of life in which sustainability issues and choices emerge:
households, transportation, agriculture, and land use/urban planning 
(Chapters~\ref{chap:households}--\ref{chap:agriculture}).
The lists of possible personal actions are provided
mostly without comment.  
Readers are encouraged to explore the suggested actions that fit their
local situation, 
always keeping in mind the global perspective provided 
by Chapters~\ref{chap:introduction}--\ref{chap:carbon_intensity}.
Questions and problems at the end of the chapter assist 
the exploration process.

\subsection{Population}
\label{sec:personal_population}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:collective_population},
rising population ($P$) is a driver for environmental impacts ($I$). 
To live a more sustainable life, individuals can consider actions
to reduce or limit population growth. 
Young adults can carefully consider family size
in the context of planetary limits and boundaries.
Young families can consider adoption as 
an alternative way to grow a family, and
adoption can be encouraged by making it less expensive.
Not everyone can or will choose these routes for their families, but
if many do, population growth may be slowed.

A deeper commitment to population reduction can be explored
through monastic life or Christian celibacy, 
satisfying the desire for family life in an alternative way.
Individuals can sponsor the education of another child to, perhaps,
lead to smaller family sizes in the next generation.
Individuals can support governmental and non-governmental organizations
advocating for family planning.


%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Affluence}
\label{sec:personal_affluence}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Section~\ref{sec:collective_affluence} notes that
rising affluence ($A$)
drives larger environmental impacts ($I$).
It is important to note that every
dollar spent in an economy implies energy and material consumption.
Every dollar spent requires energy to make, use, and dispose of devices, 
machines, and goods.
Every dollar spent requires raw materials to be extracted from nature
and, eventually, returned to nature as waste.
A growing economy serves to increase the energy and material
implications of our economic lives.
Awareness of the linkages among economic spending, energy consumption, and 
material extraction
leads to several recommended personal actions.

Individuals can either produce less or consume less.
Producing less means having less of an income. 
To live intentionally off a lower income,
high-earning individuals can pursue a 
``financial independence, retire early'' (FIRE) strategy
across their life. 
FIRE-y individuals earn ``enough'' in their early career
(say, age 20--35) to ``retire'' at 35.
Individuals spend little productive time in their career
during which they strive for a a high savings rate.
Thereafter, they live frugally.

To consume in a non-resource-intensive manner, 
individuals can spend money on low-carbon-intensity goods and services.
Tracking personal carbon emissions is easy
via any number of online carbon calculators~\cite{Padgett:2008ws}.
Resources such as \emph{How bad are bananas?} \cite{Berners-Lee:2011}
provide helpful guides for purchasing decisions.
Additionally,
individuals can purchase things that take money out of the economy
to slow down economic growth.
For example, one could buy forest land and choose to
spend no additional money for its development.
Doing so will preserve the land and slow economic growth
buy taking money out of the economy.
Individuals can (usually easily) choose 
not to be billionaires~\citep{Wilk:2021vg}!
On a per-person basis,
yachts, mansions, and private jets contribute significant CO$_2$ emissions
both when in use and when on standby.
Finally, individuals can adopt a de-growth mindset.
In short, we can all strive to live
simpler lives
in smaller spaces
with less stuff.

\subsection{Resource intensity of the economy}
\label{sec:personal_resources}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Section~\ref{sec:collective_resources} notes that
declining resource intensity ($R$)
reduces environmental impacts ($I$).
There are many ways individuals can reduce their personal resource intensity.
Few appliances are cost-effective to fix, but 
individuals can repair them anyway to
reduce the resource consumption.
(It usually takes fewer resources to repair an appliance than 
to make a new appliance.)  
Individuals can aggressively recycle all manner of goods, 
going so far as to disassemble items and recycle
all possible components.

Being frugal is often the most environmentally friendly thing you can do.
\end{mcframe}

Individuals can advocate for personal or institutional energy audits
to find energy efficiency and energy savings
opportunities at home, work, school, or church.


%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Contamination intensity of resources}
\label{sec:personal_contamination_intensity}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Section~\ref{sec:collective_resources} notes that
rising contamination intensity of resources ($C$)
leads to increased environmental impacts ($I$).
Thankfully, there are many ways individuals can reduce contamination
intensity of resources, particularly for the prime example of this book
(energy and CO$_2$ emissions).
Individuals can install \emph{renewable} energy generation systems
(typically, solar PV, solar heating, or wind) 
to reduce fossil energy consumption
and limit CO$_2$ emissions. 
Alternatively, individuals can choose to pay a premium for guaranteed 
renewable electricity from the grid.  
Finally, pursuit of \emph{net zero} energy status can encourage
homeowners to balance energy consumption 
with onsite or offsite renewable energy production.

There are many things that individuals can do to make their lives more sustainable 
in homes and apartments, 
both in deciding which homes or apartments to buy or rent
and how they are operated.
Choosing a \emph{used} home or apartment
will prevent additional carbon being embodied in the housing stock.
Choosing a \emph{smaller} home will reduce carbon emissions 
associated with heating and cooling.
Choosing a home or apartment \emph{closer} to work, school, grocery stores, and church
will reduce carbon emissions associated with daily and weekly commuting.

In terms of home operation, 
installing additional insulation can reduce energy for heating and cooling.
(See Figure~\ref{fig:energy_efficient_home}.)
Choosing \emph{efficient} (e.g., Energy Star)
appliances and lights will improve energy efficiency, 
reduce energy consumption, and 
reduce CO$_2$ emissions so long as appliance and lighting usage is unchanged.
Even better, choose \emph{not} to use some appliances, e.g., 
line drying clothes.
Choosing to live in \emph{high-occupancy} housing 
(with extended family or in co-housing arrangements)
can reduce energy and resource requirements per person.

\end{figure}

There are many things that individuals can do to make their lives more sustainable 
in transport,
both in deciding which vehicles to buy or rent
and how they are operated.
Choosing a \emph{used} vehicle
will prevent additional carbon being embodied in the vehicle itself.
Choosing a \emph{smaller} car will reduce carbon emissions 
associated with commuting.
Individuals should not ``over buy'' cars.
(If a truck is needed once per year to pull a trailer, rent.)
Choosing an electric vehicle will reduce CO$_2$ emissions
in those places where grid electricity contains a large proportion of renewables.
(See Section~\ref{sec:electric_vehicles} and Figure~\ref{fig:tesla}.)
Donâ€™t fly.

Individuals can choose to live in a cities, which, on a per-person basis
emit less CO$_2$ than suburban areas~\cite{Jones:2014tf}.
Indeed, the most sustainable transportation is often public transportation
where vehicle occupancy is high and everyone shares the carbon embodied in the
buses, trains, trolleys, or subways. 
Choosing to walk or bike (Figure~\ref{fig:commuting_bicycle}), 
usually only possible in cities,
further reduces CO$_2$ emissions. 
City dwellers can choose to not buy a car at all, preferring
on-demand rental vehicles from companies
such as Uber, Lyft, or Zip Car
when public transport will not meet their needs.
To reduce transportation emissions from goods and service consumption, 
local purchasing can be pursued.
