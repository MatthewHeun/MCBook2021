\chapter{Personal action}
\label{chap:personal_action}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\epigraph{People donâ€™t spring into action just because they see smoke; 
they spring into action because they see others rushing in with water.}
{Leor Hackel and Gregg Sparkman} % on Slate.com Oct. 26, 2018.

This is the second of two chapters on actions to encourage sustainable 
living for individuals and society.
This chapter is a companion to 
Chapter~\ref{chap:government},
which focused on collective ways 
to achieve a sustainable society, 
often by changing the ``rules of the game.''
In contrast, 
this chapter (\ref{chap:personal_action}) focuses on individual actions
that can be taken 
within existing systems, structures, and political environments.
Individual actions are steps that can be taken %by individuals and families
to become more sustainable \emph{in spite of}
trends or incentives in broader society
that foster unsustainable practices or consumption.

This chapter answers the question 
``what can I do today to live a more sustainable life?''
% OR to contribute to a more sustainable society.
Again, like Chapter~\ref{chap:government}, 
there are many ways that individuals can take action
to become more sustainable. 
This chapter opens with stories of individuals striving to live
more sustainable lives. 
Thereafter, the chapter is structured similarly 
to Chapter~\ref{chap:government}
with \emph{sustainability sentences}, organized first by
the $PARC$ terms (Chapters~\ref{chap:population}--\ref{chap:impact_intensity})
of the IPARX equation (Equation~\ref{eq:IPARX})
and second by 
areas of life in which sustainability issues and choices emerge:
households, transportation, agriculture, and land use/urban planning 
(Chapters~\ref{chap:households}--\ref{chap:agriculture}).
The lists of possible personal actions are provided
mostly without comment.  
Readers are encouraged to explore the suggested actions that fit their
local situation, 
always keeping in mind the global perspective provided 
by Chapters~\ref{chap:introduction}--\ref{chap:impact_intensity}.
Questions and problems at the end of the chapter assist 
the exploration process.

\section{Stories of individual actions}
\label{sec:stories_individual_actions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

From 2019--2021, 
Edgar McGregor picked up litter in the Angeles National Forest
in Southern California
for at least one
hour per day for 589 consecutive days~\cite{npr030821}. 
He earned more than \$400 (donated to charity) from recyclable materials he 
collected and, on at least one day, he filled a dumpster with a thousand pounds 
of trash. 
McGregor's actions illustrate that large, seemingly impossible tasks, like cleaning
a large (198 acres) public space from decades of litter, can be accomplished with dedication
and perseverance.
His documentation of progress on Twitter could be an example of the sustainability 
sentence: Individual + Education + Impact intensity. 
(See discussion question Q12.\ref{question:mcgregror} for further discussion.)

Wangari Maathai was a veterinary professor, author, 
member of the Kenyan parliament, founder of the Green Belt movement 
(see Question Q\ref{chap:land_use_urban_planning}.\ref{question:green_wall}),
and Nobel Peace Prize laureate.
She lived a fascinating, often turbulent, life.
Many ``sustainability sentences'' could describe her work;
Individual + Education + Land use is one good choice.
Her biography illustrates that bringing change, even positive change, often 
exacts a personal price. 
Those who want change must be willing to endure.

Joseph Lstiburek is the founding principal of Building Science Corporation and the
originator of the perfect wall concept.
Because his research and techniques have lead to building-code improvements that
save energy and prolong building life, his sustainability sentence could be
Individual + Research + Housing or Individual + Education + Housing.
Not all educators are teachers or professors and not all researchers work
for a university or tech start up.

\section{PARC terms}
\label{sec:personal_parc_terms}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Population ($P$)}
\label{sec:personal_population}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:collective_population},
rising population ($P$) is a driver for environmental impacts ($I$). 
To live a more sustainable life, individuals can consider actions
to reduce or limit population growth. 


%..............................
\paragraph{Individual+Choices+Population} 
\label{sec:individual+choices+population}
%..............................

Young adults can carefully consider family size
in the context of planetary limits and boundaries.
Young families can consider adoption as 
an alternative way to grow a family, and
adoption can be encouraged by making it less expensive.
Not everyone can or will choose these routes for their families, but
if many do, population growth may be slowed.

A deeper commitment to population reduction can be explored
through lifestyle changes.
Individuals can consider monastic life or Christian celibacy, 
satisfying the desire for family life in an alternative way.

Individuals can sponsor the education of another child to, perhaps,
lead to smaller family sizes in the next generation.


%..............................
\paragraph{Individual+Education+Population} 
\label{sec:individual+education+population}
%..............................

Individuals can support governmental and non-governmental organizations
educating citizens on family planning.


%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Affluence ($A$)}
\label{sec:personal_affluence}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Section~\ref{sec:collective_affluence} notes that
rising affluence ($A$)
drives larger environmental impacts ($I$).
It is important to note that every
dollar spent in an economy implies energy and material consumption.
Every dollar spent requires energy to make, use, and dispose of devices, 
machines, and goods.
Every dollar spent requires raw materials to be extracted from nature
and, eventually, returned to nature as waste.
A growing economy serves to increase the energy and material
implications of our economic lives.
Awareness of the linkages among economic spending, energy consumption, and 
material extraction
leads to several recommended personal actions.


%..............................
\paragraph{Individuals+Choices+Affluence} 
\label{sec:individuals+choices+affluence}
%..............................

Individuals can either produce less or consume less.
Producing less means having less of an income. 
To live intentionally off a lower income,
high-earning individuals can pursue a 
``financial independence, retire early'' (FIRE) strategy
across their life. 
FIRE-y individuals earn ``enough'' in their early career
(say, age 20--35) to ``retire'' at an early age.
Individuals spend little productive time in their career
during which they strive for a high savings rate.
Thereafter, they live frugally.

Additionally,
individuals can purchase things that take money out of the economy
to slow down economic growth.
For example, one could buy forest land and choose to
spend no additional money for its development.
Doing so will preserve the land and slow economic growth.
Individuals can (usually easily) choose 
not to be billionaires~\citep{Wilk:2021vg}!
On a per-person basis,
yachts, mansions, and private jets contribute significant CO$_2$ emissions
both when in use and when on standby.
Individuals can adopt a de-growth mindset.
In short, we can all strive to live
simpler lives
in smaller spaces
with less stuff.


%..............................
\paragraph{Individuals+Education+Affluence} 
\label{sec:individuals+education+affluence}
%..............................

To consume in a non-resource-intensive manner, 
individuals can educate themselves on low-carbon-intensity 
goods and services.
Tracking personal carbon emissions is easy
via any number of online carbon calculators~\cite{Padgett:2008ws}.
Resources such as \emph{How bad are bananas?} \cite{Berners-Lee:2011}
provide helpful guides for purchasing decisions.


%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Resource intensity of the economy ($R$)}
\label{sec:personal_resources}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Section~\ref{sec:collective_resources} notes that
declining resource intensity ($R$)
reduces environmental impacts ($I$).


%..............................
\paragraph{Individuals+Choices+Resource intensity} 
\label{sec:individuals+choices+resource_intensity}
%..............................

There are many ways individuals can reduce their personal resource intensity.
Few appliances are cost-effective to fix, but 
individuals can repair them anyway to
reduce the resource consumption.
(It usually takes fewer natural resources to repair an appliance than 
to make a new appliance.)  
Individuals can aggressively recycle all manner of goods, 
going so far as to disassemble items and recycle
all possible components.

%^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
\begin{mcframe}[0.90\textwidth](0.85\textwidth)
%^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Being frugal is often the most environmentally friendly thing you can do.
\end{mcframe}


%..............................
\paragraph{Individuals+Reseach+Resource intensity} 
\label{sec:individuals+research+resource_intensity}
%..............................

Individuals can advocate for personal or institutional energy audits
to find energy efficiency and energy savings
opportunities at home, work, school, or church.


%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Impact intensity of resources ($X$)}
\label{sec:personal_impact_intensity}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Section~\ref{sec:collective_resources} notes that
rising impact intensity of resources ($X$)
leads to increased environmental impacts ($I$).


%..............................
\paragraph{Individuals+Choices+Impact intensity} 
\label{sec:individuals+choices+comtemination_intensity}
%..............................

Thankfully, there are many ways individuals can reduce the impact
intensity of resources, particularly for the prime example of this book
(energy and CO$_2$ emissions).
Individuals can install \emph{renewable} energy generation systems
(typically, solar PV, solar heating, or wind) 
to reduce fossil energy consumption
and limit CO$_2$ emissions. 
Alternatively, individuals can choose to pay a premium for guaranteed 
renewable electricity from the grid.  
Finally, pursuit of \emph{net zero} energy status can encourage
homeowners to balance energy consumption 
with onsite or offsite renewable energy production.

\end{figure}

There are many things that individuals can do to make their lives more sustainable 
in homes and apartments, 
both in deciding which homes or apartments to buy or rent
and how they are operated.

\paragraph{Individual+Choices+Housing}
Choosing a \emph{used} home or apartment
will prevent additional carbon being embodied in the housing stock.
Choosing a \emph{smaller} home will reduce carbon emissions 
associated with heating and cooling.
Choosing a home or apartment \emph{closer} to work, school, grocery stores, and church
will reduce carbon emissions associated with daily and weekly commuting.
Choosing to work from home will eliminate commuting emissions altogether!
In terms of home operation, 
installing additional insulation can reduce energy for heating and cooling.
(See Figure~\ref{fig:energy_efficient_home}.)
Choosing \emph{efficient} (e.g., Energy Star)
appliances and lights will improve energy efficiency, 
reduce energy consumption, and 
reduce CO$_2$ emissions so long as appliance and lighting usage is unchanged.
Even better, choose \emph{not} to use some appliances, e.g., 
line drying clothes.
Choosing to live in \emph{high-occupancy} housing 
(with extended family or in co-housing arrangements)
can reduce energy and resource requirements per person.

\paragraph{Individual+Education+Housing}
Of course, knowing which of the choices above to make requires educating yourself
about options and being aware of tradeoffs.
All consumer purchasing decisions have implications for sustainability through the 
broader economy and the rebound effect.
For example, there are diminishing returns to insulation. 
Buying and installing insulation in your house has positive sustainability 
implications---to a point.
Beyond that, possible energy savings are more than offset by stimulating consumption
in the broader economy.
Individuals should be aware of this inflection point and act accordingly.
More broadly, there are many actions that are advertised as ``sustainable'' 
but are, in reality, just overconsumption. 
For example, choosing to live ``off grid'' is very expensive relative to on-grid
living due to the economies of scale.

\end{figure}

There are many things that individuals can do to make their lives more sustainable 
in transport.

\paragraph{Individual+Choices+Transportation}
Individuals can decide which vehicles to buy or rent.
Choosing a \emph{used} vehicle
will prevent additional carbon being embodied in the vehicle itself.
Choosing a \emph{smaller} car will reduce carbon emissions 
associated with commuting.
Individuals should not ``over buy'' cars.
(If a truck is needed once per year to pull a trailer, rent.)
Choosing an electric vehicle will reduce CO$_2$ emissions
in those places where grid electricity contains a large proportion of renewables.
(See Section~\ref{sec:electric_vehicles} and Figure~\ref{fig:tesla}.)
Donâ€™t fly.
% Individuals can choose how to operate their vehicles (or not).
% Walking or using mass transit instead driving a personal vehicle is high-impact 
% practice for sustainability (see Table~\ref{tab:US-Carbon-Table}).

Individuals can choose to live in a cities, which, on a per-person basis
emit less CO$_2$ than suburban areas~\cite{Jones:2014tf}.
Indeed, the most sustainable transportation is often public transportation
where vehicle occupancy is high and everyone shares the carbon embodied in the
buses, trains, trolleys, or subways. 
Choosing to walk or bike (Figure~\ref{fig:commuting_bicycle}), 
usually only possible in cities,
further reduces CO$_2$ emissions. 
City dwellers can choose to not buy a car at all, preferring
on-demand rental vehicles from companies
such as Uber, Lyft, or Zip Car
when public transport will not meet their needs.
To reduce transportation emissions from goods and service consumption, 
local purchasing can be pursued.

        \label{fig:food_purchasing_options}
\end{figure}

Individuals have considerable choice of what to eat, where to obtain food, and
how to prepare food. 
This section presents two example ``sentences for sustainability'' related to 
food production and consumption.

\paragraph{Individual+Choices+Agriculture}
Probably the most important and high-impact activity an individual can take around
food is to reduce as much as possible the amount of food waste they generate.
Any wasted food embodies resources (such as energy) and emissions.
Individuals can adopt a climate-friendly or climate-friendlier diet, that is, to
improve the sustainability of \emph{what you eat}.
Typically these involve reductions to meat consumption, particularly beef.
There are a variety of ways to improve the sustainability of \emph{food production}.
Recall that what is least expensive is often the most environmentally friendly.
Cooking at home minimizes packaging and is usually the cheapest option (compared 
to say, buying prepared foods or eating at a restaurant).
Buy \emph{ingredients} (see Figure~\ref{fig:suburban_produce_aisle}), then 
\emph{make} food.
One step beyond that would be to raise your own food by gardening or harvest 
wild food, for instance by hunting, fishing, and/or gathering wild plants. 
One side benefit to such foraging is an investment in the state of the ecosystem.
A partial measure is buying direct from local farmers, perhaps at a farmers' 
market (see Figure~\ref{fig:urban_farmers_market}) or through community-supported 
agriculture.

\paragraph{Individual+Research+Agriculture}
The examples in the previous paragraph are based on general assumptions about what
is most likely to be sustainable behavior.
You could collect personal data to quantify what is most sustainable in your 
particular context or situation.
For example, perhaps you could develop a new meatless version of a favorite recipe.
Another example would be to collect data on what plants do best in your garden and
to record what inputs (water, fertilizer, your time) are required, which would
allow you to optimize your gardening for maximum sustainability impact.

        \label{fig:adorning_lawns}
\end{figure}

This section presents two example ``sentences for sustainability'' related to 
land use and urban planning.

\paragraph{Individual+Choices+Land Use}
Where you live is a key land-use decision in the sense that it determines how you
relate to all the land around you, mainly through your transportation.
However, how you use your domicile is also important.
How many people in your household? 
How will you use the space around your dwelling?
Will you have a lawn (with or without lawn chemicals) like Figure~\ref{fig:kentucky_bluegrass}?
Will you have a vegetable garden?
Will you grow native plants?
Figure~\ref{fig:gutter_diversion} shows a curb-cutout that 
diverts surface rainwater
from a roadside drain to a small roadside garden.
Such gutter diversions reduce the amount of surface runoff 
that flows directly into roadside drains and local waterways.

\paragraph{Individual+Law+Urban Planning}
Get involved in your local zoning board, drain commission, or other local government entity. 
Advocate for local \emph{and} regional solutions. 
Being involved in local politics is one of the best ways to make a difference for 
sustainability.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

College and university students are at a very important time in their lives.
Decisions made in the next few years will set the course of
interactions with the environment for decades to come. 
As you embark on that process, 
ask yourself the questions shown in Table~\ref{tab:personal_energy_actions}.
The questions crystallize many possible individual actions discussed throughout this book.
Table~\ref{tab:personal_energy_actions} provides answers 
that move in the direction of a more-sustainable world 
and make a difference to the planet
(without requiring an agrarian, pre-1900s lifestyle).

Note: for Questions Q\ref{chap:personal_action}.\ref{question:mcgregror}-
Q\ref{chap:personal_action}.\ref{question:lstiburek} it would be helpful to 
read more in depth about Edgar McGregor, \emph{Juliana v. United States},
Wangari Maathai, and Joseph Lstiburek.

\begin{questions}

\item While laudable and environmentally friendly, were Edgar McGregor's actions
      (see Section~\ref{sec:stories_individual_actions}) \emph{necessary} for 
      \emph{sustanability}?
      To put it another way, would the park have continued to function as a park if 
      Edgar McGregor had not removed the litter?
      The Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation is in charge of
      ``his'' park. 
      How do McGregor's actions affect their stewardship of the park, and,
      in particular, their clean-up efforts?
      Compare and contrast the behavior of McGregor with Bill Peterson from 
      Question Q\ref{chap:government}.\ref{question:trailer_trash}.
      \label{question:mcgregror}

\item The case \emph{Juliana v. United States} is a climate-related lawsuit filed
      against the United States, similar in some respects to the suit mentioned
      in Question Q\ref{chap:planetary_boundaries}.\ref{question:shell_lawsuit}.
      Unlike the Dutch case, the U.S. case did not go to trial; it was dismissed.
      The decision to dismiss the case was made by a three-judge panel.
      One judge, Josephine Stanton, dissented from that decision to dismiss and wrote 
      ``the mere fact that this suit cannot alone halt climate change does not 
      mean that it presents no claim suitable for judicial resolution.''
      She characterized dismissal as a missed opportunity to rectify a grave injustice.
      However, when the dismissal was appealed \emph{en banc}, that is, to the
      full court, the appeal was denied without written dissent, meaning that 
      Judge Stanton did not (in writing, at least) object to the denial of the appeal.
      What can you infer about Judge Stanton's problem-solving approach from this story?
      Compare and contrast the problem-solving approach and conduct of 
      Judge Stanton with that of Edgar McGregor and Bill Peterson.
      Which approach is most relevant for you?
      
\item Wangari Maathai (see Section~\ref{sec:stories_individual_actions}) was jailed
      many times in her life for her protests.
      How were her aims the same or different from Edgar McGregor and/or Bill Peterson?
      How was her process the same or different from them?
      How about the success she achieved?
      To what do you attribute the differences? 
      (Person, context, aim, method, or something else?)
      
\item In contrast to Wangari Maathai, Joseph Lstiburek is a much less controversial
      (and less well known) figure.
      Which of these two people do you think has made the greater contribution 
      to sustainability?
      What factors influence your answer?
      What factors account for the difference in controversy?
      What factors account for the difference in fame?
      What broader implications, if any, for the quest for sustainability can 
      you draw from the stories of these two individuals?
      \label{question:lstiburek}
      
\item Chapter~\ref{chap:population} had several discussion questions about families
      and the ethics of population control; we won't repeat those topics here.
      Instead, consider the sustainability sentence Corporation + Research + Population.
      What springs to mind? What are your reactions to this sentence?
      (As a bonus question: revisit the discussion questions in 
      Chapter~\ref{chap:population}. 
      Have your answers to any of those questions changed as a result of reading
      the rest of this book?)
      
\item One example of the sustainability sentence Corporation + Research + Population 
      is the use of robots for elder care in Japan.
      ``Rapid population aging and the shortage of caregivers have spurred the 
      government to promote the use of robots in nursing homes. 
      As part of its robot strategy, the government began to provide robot 
      subsidies to nursing homes in 2015. Already by 2016, about 15\% of the 
      countryâ€™s nursing homes had adopted robots''~\cite{aparc_fsi}.
      What are the humanitarian implications of substituting robots for human 
      caregivers for a vulnerable segment of the population?
      Given Japan's aging population and shrinking workforce, what are the concerns
      about \emph{not} using robot caregivers?
      Fundamentally, do you believe that robots ever could substitute for human 
      caregivers?
      Is it even theoretically possible for robots to become substitutable for human
      relationships? 
      What reasoning or beliefs lie behind your answer?
      What are your feelings about the \emph{corporations} that develop
      and manufacture the robots?
      Would you trust your relative to a robot? Yourself to a robot?
      How is this different than trusting the human employee of a long-term care facility?
      
\item Compare and contrast ``financial independence, retire early'' with the 
      ``lying flat'' movement. 
      How are their goals different?
      How are their sustainability implications similar?
      Does either approach hold appeal for you?
      Do you have any other ideas for mitigating the sustainability effects of your
      affluence?
      
\item Which sustainability sentence holds greater appeal to you: Government + 
      Research + Housing \emph{or} Corporation + Research + Housing? Why?
      What if we substituted the action Education for Research?
      How do you see each of these options as affecting your own possible 
      Choice actions? How about your life more broadly?
      
\item Which sustainability sentence holds greater appeal to you: Government + 
      Research + Transportation \emph{or} Corporation + Research + Transportation? Why?
      What if we substituted the action Education for Research?
      How do you see each of these options as affecting your own possible 
      Choice actions? How about your life more broadly?
      Compare and contrast your responses to this question with your responses to
      the previous question.
      
\item What Choices do you have for reducing food waste?

\item What are your reactions to the suggestion that hunting, fishing, or foraging
      for wild food can enhance sustainability?
      What food would you like to obtain?
      How feasible is that for you?
      What resources would it take? 
      Reflect on the situation of someone without those resources.
      
\item One of the sustainability suggestions from 
      Section~\ref{sec:personal_affluence} is to buy land and hold it for 
      conservation.
      Is this a Choice you are likely to make in your lifetime?
      Given information in Figure~\ref{fig:CarbonStorage}, what sort of land
      would you seek to purchase?
      How will you manage it?
      Does desirability of the land for any other purpose (say, hunting, farming, 
      or recreation) affect your answer?
      Comment on the relative desirability and availability of the different types
      of land represented in Figure~\ref{fig:CarbonStorage}.

\begin{projects}

\item Looking back over the last ten years of your life, create a 
      \emph{sustainability scorecard} for your life. 
      Is your scorecard multifaceted?
      Does it involve the three aspects of sustainability (Figure~\ref{fig:venn_diagram}), 
      the IPARX equation (\ref{eq:IPARX}), and the sustainability challenge
      areas of Chapters~\ref{chap:households}-\ref{chap:land_use_urban_planning}?
      Given what you have learned from this book so far, how would you rate
      your past? Do you plan to make any changes for the future?
      
\item Every college and university has a History department 
      that reinterprets the past in light of the present. 
      No colleges or universities (to our knowledge) 
      have a Department of the Future. 
      If colleges and universities had a Department of the Future, 
      this book might be a good textbook for its courses. 
      History is easy. Future is hard. But we must try!
      In 500 words or less, write a letter to yourself 
      that you will read in 5 years.
      Tell your future self how you intend to live your life 
      in response to your learning from this book.
      The letter should
      (a) identify concrete steps and decisions you will take in your future,
      (b) tie those concrete steps to specific knowledge gained from this book, and 
      (c) list questions that you want your future self to consider.

\item Conduct an energy audit on your home, work, school, or church.
      What energy-saving opportunities can you identify?
      Which would have the greatest sustainability impact?
      Which of them are cost effective?
      How can you mitigate the rebound effect for your changes?
      \label{project:personal_energy_audit}
      
\item Analyze any changes suggested by the results of project 
      P\ref{chap:personal_action}.\ref{project:personal_energy_audit}
      in three ways: from a cost/benefit standpoint (that is, \emph{monetary}), 
      in terms of embodied \emph{energy} versus energy savings, 
      and in terms of embodied \emph{carbon} emissions versus carbon emissions reductions 
      (resulting from the energy you would save).
      Are the changes you are considering warranted under any of the three
      analyses?
      If so, over what time frame?
      Do the three viewpoints agree or are they different in any meaningful way?
      Next conduct a risk assessment. 
      What is the probability your improvement will last long enough to at least
      break even?
      Under what scenario(s) would your improvement or upgrade fail to last long
      enough to at least break even?
      (For example, the box on page \pageref{mcframe_EV} noted that 
      ``an [electric vehicle] that is totaled shortly after manufacture will 
      never achieve its potential emissions reductions.'')
      
\item Use a scale and dedicated trash receptacles to track your food use and waste 
      over a 30-day period. 
      Weigh all the food that comes into your house.
      Weigh all the packaging waste (receptacle \#1).
      Weigh all the food waste (receptacle \#2).
      What patterns to you notice?
      Where are opportunities for enhanced sustainability?
      Research the carbon coefficients for different kinds of food and food packaging.
      What is having a greater impact, your food waste or food packaging?
      
\item Start a blog or social media account dedicated to local politics. 
      Pick a local political office or body, like the city council, county drain
      commission, zoning board of appeals, or school board.
      Go to all their meetings for at least a year. 
      Peruse all meeting documents.
      Imagine that you are a reporter documenting sustainability issues 
      over the long term.
      Report on what issues your representative government officials face. 
      What do you notice that \emph{isn't} coming before them?
      % Start of new questions added by MKH on 3 Dec 2021
      In your writing, can you identify places where the framework
      presented in this book has influenced your thinking and writing?
      E.g., even if you don't explicitly refer to the IPARX identity, 
      does it affect your writing? 
      Even if you don't explicitly refer to the sustainability challenge areas, 
      do they affect your thinking?
      Even if you don't discuss ``sustainability sentences,''
      does the SUBJECT+ACTION+OBJECT framing assist your reporting
      on local politics?
