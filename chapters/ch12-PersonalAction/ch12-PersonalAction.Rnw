There are many things that individuals can do to make their lives more sustainable 
in homes and apartments, 
both in deciding which homes or apartments to buy or rent
and how they are operated.
Choosing a \emph{used} home or apartment
will prevent additional carbon being embodied in the housing stock.
Choosing a \emph{smaller} home will reduce carbon emissions 
associated with heating and cooling.
Choosing a home or apartment \emph{closer} to work, school, grocery stores, and church
will reduce carbon emissions associated with daily and weekly commuting.

In terms of home operation, 
installing additional insulation can reduce energy for heating and cooling.
(See Figure~\ref{fig:energy_efficient_home}.)
Choosing \emph{efficient} (e.g., Energy Star)
appliances and lights will improve energy efficiency, 
reduce energy consumption, and 
reduce CO$_2$ emissions so long as appliance and lighting usage is unchanged.
Choosing to live in \emph{high-occupancy} housing 
(with extended family or in co-housing arrangements)
can reduce energy and resource requirements per person.
Choosing to install \emph{renewable} energy generation
(typically, solar PV, solar heating, or wind) can reduce fossil energy consumption
and limit CO$_2$ emissions. 
Finally, pursuit of \emph{net zero} energy status can encourage
homeowners to balance energy consumption with onsite or offsite renewable energy production.
