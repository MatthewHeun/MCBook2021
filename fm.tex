\ABSTRACT
\noindent
%The abstract goes here. 
%The Abstract and the keywords have to fit in this page.
This book is an introduction to the many challenges of sustainability.
The first half of the book develops a framework for sustainability thinking.
The second half considers application areas and personal and corporate responses
to sustainability challenges.
Basic facts, figures, and information related to sustainability are presented
in a way that should convey a sense of scale for the many sustainability challenges
we face.
The objective is for readers to develop a sense of scale related to sustainability challenges.
Throughout, the end-of-chapter projects and discussion questions focus on tradeoffs among 
competing goods and the ethical and social implications of decisions related to
sustainability.
This book was written for a university seminar course on sustainability but could
be used in other small-group discussion formats. 
It is intended to be easy to read but hard to digest.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Who should use this book} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This book is for anyone who is interested in the many challenges of 
sustainability.
It is an introduction to the many challenges of sustainability
and it provides a framework for thinking about sustainability.
It does not assume any prior background knowledge,
apart from basic numeracy and the ability to comprehend graphical information.
This book is not intended to be a comprehensive of all aspects of sustainability,
nor will it provide many solutions to sustainability problems. 
It is intended to be easy to read but hard to digest.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{How to use this book} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This book was written to support a university seminar class %one semester-hour 
on sustainability. 
The primary focus of class time is in-class discussion, so 
the end-of-chapter discussion questions should provide significant value. 
Therefore, this book could be used in other settings that prioritorize discussion,
like a book club or small group.
Individual chapters, or sets of chapters, can easily be
used to support a wide variety of class structures, types, and levels.
Students should read the text on their own, out of class, to get 
basic information related to  the challenges of sustainability. 
We encourage instructors to use a basic and straightforward quiz on the reading 
through your course management platform to hold students accountable for the 
reading. 
Students should review discussion questions ahead of each class and 
prepare for discussion.

It is often said that ``you only get out what you put in'' to an activity.
We encourage readers to be critical.

Readers will do well to keep this list of key terms handy as they read.

\section*{What you should get out of this book} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%t

This book contains four main contributions.

\begin{itemize}

  \item Basic facts, figures, and information related to sustainability. 
        We don't assume you start with any prior knowledge, but by the time you finish 
        reading this book you will know basic facts like carbon dioxide 
        concentration in the atmosphere. 
        Furthermore, you should have a \emph{sense of scale} related to sustainability 
        information. 
        That is, which things are big and important and 
        which are smaller and less relavant. 
        To this end, the information is presented \emph{graphically} as much as possible 
        to show relative magnitudes and trends.
        
  \item We provide an explanatory framework for thinking about sustainability,
        primarily in chapters \ref{chap:introduction}--\ref{chap:impact_intensity}.

  \item The end-of-chapter discussion questions address moral, ethical, philosophical,
        and practical aspects of sustainability. 
        Most don't have objective answers. 
        Instead, the questions should help illustrate the importance
        of worldview, values, preferences, and \emph{a priori} assumptions 
        in each person's approach sustainability. 
        
  \item The end-of-chapter project questions range in scope from a long
        homework problem to a graduate thesis project. 
        If graduate study on a sustainability topic is in your future, perhaps you can 
        take inspiration from one or more of these project questions. 
        Instructors can use one---or perhaps more---of these questions for a 
        semester-long project, optionally with in-class presentations.
      
\end{itemize}

By the end of the book you should see that sustainability is an important, 
urgent, difficult, but solvable problem that requires personal and corporate 
commitments. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Text, organization, and schedule} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%t

At one chapter a week, the twelve chapters in this book don't quite fill a typical 
university semester. 
Of course, you don't have to be in a university context to use this book. 
A book club or small group are also appropriate audiences---sustainability 
is important for everyone. 
However, if you are in a university context, here are a few ways that you could fill the 
remaining weeks of your semester. 
Use class time for project presentations. 
Perhaps groups of students could each be assigned different project questions and 
at the end of the semester, each could share their results.
Alternatively, one or more class sessions could be devoted to a topic or topics 
your instructor finds personally interesting, like biofuels, grid-scale storage, 
or media coverage of sustainability. 
At Calvin University, our class devotes a week to worldview implications for 
sustainability. 
You could use all or part(s) of \emph{Beyond stewardship: New approaches to 
creation care}~\citep{Warners:2019aa}
or \emph{Current disciplines and worldviews are insufficient
to address sustainability challenges}~\cite{VanH2019} as a starting point for discussion. 
On the other hand, instructors don't need to use all of the book. 
IEEE Xplore makes it easy to assign either a single chapter or a group of chapters 
as supplementary material for many different types of classes.
% Lastly, if you read all the way to the end of the Preface, great job! 
% Give youself a gold star. 
Now, on to the good stuff!
