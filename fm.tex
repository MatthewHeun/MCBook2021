\ABSTRACT
\noindent
%The abstract goes here. 
%The Abstract and the keywords have to fit in this page.
This book is intended to be an introduction to the many challenges of 
sustainability.
It provides basic facts, figures, and information related to sustainability
in a way that is easy to digest.
The focus is on a quantitative understanding of the challenges of sustainability.
The first half of the book develops a framework for sustainability thinking.
The second half considers application areas and personal and corporate responses
to sustainability challenges.
Throughout, the end-of-chapter discussion questions focus on tradeoffs among 
competing goods and the ethical and social implications of decisions related to
sustainability.
This book was written for a university seminar course on sustainability but could
be used in other small-group discussion formats. 
It is intended to be easy to read but hard to digest.

\section*{Who should use this book} 
This book is for anyone who is interested in the many challenges of 
sustainability.
It is an introduction and, as such, does not assume any prior background knowledge,
apart from just a little bit of math.
The book is not intended to be comprehensive but is intended to be easy to read.\\

\section*{How to use this book} 
%Read it. Seriously; that's what you do with books.
This book was written to support a university seminar class %one semester-hour 
on sustainability. The primary focus of class time is in-class discussion, so 
the end-of-chapter discussion questions should provide significant value. 
Therefore, individual chapters, or sets of chapters, can easily be
used to support a wide variety of class structures, types, and levels.
Students should read the text on their own, out of class, to get 
basic information related to  the challenges of sustainability. 
We encourage instructors to use a basic and straightforward quiz on the reading 
through your course management platform to hold students accountable for the 
reading. 
Students should review discussion questions ahead of each class and 
prepare for discussion. \\

\section*{What you should get out of this book} 
This book contains four main contributions.
\begin{itemize}
\item Basic facts, figures, and information related to sustainability. 
We don't assume you start with any prior knowledge but by the time you finish 
reading this book you will know basic facts like carbon dioxide 
concentration in the atmosphere and what are the anthropogenic sources of 
carbon dioxide. 
Furthermore, you should have a \emph{sense of scale} related to sustainability 
information. 
That is, which things are big and important and which are smaller and less relavant. 
To this end, the information is presented \emph{graphically} as much as possible 
to show relative magnitudes.
\item We provide an explanatory framework or scaffold for thinking about sustainability,
primarily in chapters \ref{chap:introduction}-\ref{chap:impact_intensity}.
\item The end-of-chapter discussion questions get at moral, ethical, philosophical,
and practical aspects of sustainability. 
They don't have %\sout{right} 
objective answers. 
Instead, the questions should help illustrate the role that worldview, values, 
preferences, and \emph{a priori} assumptions have in how we approach sustainability. 
%social pillar?
\item The end-of-chapter project questions range in difficulty from a long
homework problem to a graduate thesis project. 
If graduate study on a sustainability topic is in your future, perhaps you can 
take inspiration from one or more of these project questions. 
Instructors can use one -- or perhaps more -- of these questions for a 
semester-long project, optionally with in-class presentations, for a class.
\end{itemize}
By the end of the book you should see that sustainability is an important, 
urgent, difficult, but solvable problem that requires personal and corporate 
commitments. \\

\section*{Text, organization, and schedule} 
At one chapter a week, the twelve chapters in this book don't quite fill a typical 
university semester. 
Of course, you don't have to be in a university context to use this book. 
A book club or church small group are also appropriate audiences -- sustainability 
is important for everyone. 
However, if you are in a university context, here are a few ways that you could fill the 
remaining weeks of your semester. 
Use class time for project presentations, as mentioned above. 
Perhaps groups of students could each be assigned different project questions and 
at the end of the semester, each could share their results.
Alternatively, a class session or sessions could be devoted to a topic or topics 
your instructor finds personally interesting, like biofuels, grid-scale storage, 
or media coverage of sustainability. 
At Calvin University, our class devotes a week to worldview implications for 
sustainability. 
You could use all or part(s) of \emph{Beyond stewardship: New approaches to 
creation care}~\citep{Warners:2019aa}
or our paper \emph{Current disciplines and worldviews are insufficient
to address sustainability challenges} (2019) as a starting place for discussion. 
% CES website doesn't have 2019 proceedings!
On the other hand, instructors don't need to use all of the book. 
IEEE Xplore makes it easy to assign either a single chapter or a group of chapters 
as supplementary material for many different types of classes.
Lastly, if you read all the way to the end of the Preface, great job! 
Give youself a gold star. 
Now, on to the good stuff...
